Palindrome - A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. Whether applied to words, phrases, or numbers, palindromes exhibit symmetry. Examples include "radar" and "level." Checking for palindromes involves comparing characters from both ends, making it a common problem in programming and algorithmic challenges.

Fibonacci sequence - The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. The sequence begins 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and continues, following the pattern of adding the last two numbers to generate the next one.

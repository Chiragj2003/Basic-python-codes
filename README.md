## Palindrome - 
A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward. Whether applied to words, phrases, or numbers, palindromes exhibit symmetry. Examples include "radar" and "level." Checking for palindromes involves comparing characters from both ends, making it a common problem in programming and algorithmic challenges.


## Fibonacci sequence - 
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. The sequence begins 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and continues, following the pattern of adding the last two numbers to generate the next one.


## Leap year finder - 
A leap year is a year that is evenly divisible by 4, except for years that are divisible by 100. However, years divisible by 400 are leap years. In programming, a leap year can be determined using code that checks these conditions. It involves using logical operators to verify divisibility and applying if-else statements to handle the rules for leap years. The code typically returns a boolean value, indicating whether a given year is a leap year or not.


## Perfect number finder -  
A Perfect Number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. In a programming context, a Perfect Number Finder code identifies and validates whether a given number is perfect. It involves calculating the divisors of the number, summing them, and then comparing the total with the original number. If the sums match, the number is deemed a perfect number. This code is implemented using loops and conditional statements to perform the necessary calculations and checks.


## Prime number finder - 
A Prime Number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. In programming, a Prime Number Checker code is designed to determine whether a given positive integer is a prime number. The code typically involves iterating through potential divisors up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility. If the number has no divisors other than 1 and itself, it is considered a prime number. The code often utilizes loops and conditional statements for efficient computation and 


## Random Password Generator - 
A Random Password Generator is a program that creates a secure and unpredictable sequence of characters to enhance password strength. In programming, this generator code involves selecting characters randomly from a predefined set (including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols) and arranging them in a way that forms a password. The length and complexity of the password are typically customizable parameters. This code helps users generate strong and unique passwords for better security in various applications. It employs randomization functions to ensure the unpredictability and strength of the generated passwords.


## Tip Calculator
A Tip Calculator is a program designed to assist users in determining the appropriate gratuity amount for a service. In programming, the Tip Calculator code typically takes input values such as the total bill amount, desired tip percentage, and the number of people splitting the bill. The code then calculates the tip amount and the total amount each person should contribute. This type of code often involves basic arithmetic operations and user input handling to facilitate a quick and accurate calculation of tips in different scenarios.
